## Welcome to my website

I pursuing my Ph.D. jointly at the Brandenburg Technical University and the Technical University-Berlin. My research group's official page is [here](https://www.b-tu.de/fg-akustik/).


### Research

My primary area of research is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA). I prefer the Lagrangian approach to solve the fluid flow equations.

- Vortex Dynamics
- Meshless Methods
- Hamiltonian Dynamics
- Synthetic Turbulence Modelling
- Aeroacoustics
- Vortex Sound
- Stochastic Modelling
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- Monte-Carlo Methods and Uncertainity Quantification
- Parallel Computing
 
### Research Projects

- Stochastic Modelling of Leading-Edge Noise [(GRS)](https://www.b-tu.de/researchschool/cluster/cluster-3-stochmethod)
- High-Fidelity Simulations of flow inside the Porous Materials
