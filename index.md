## Welcome to my website

I pursuing my Ph.D. jointly at the Brandenburg Technical University and the Technical University-Berlin. My research group's official page is [here](https://www.b-tu.de/fg-akustik/).


### Research

My primary area of research is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA). I prefer the Lagrangian approach to solve the fluid flow equations.

- Vortex Dynamics
- Meshless Methods
- Hamiltonian Dynamics
- Synthetic Turbulence Modelling
- Aeroacoustics
- Vortex Sound
- Stochastic Modelling
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- Monte-Carlo Methods and Uncertainity Quantification
- Parallel Computing
 
### Research Projects

- Stochastic Modelling of Leading-Edge Noise [(GRS)](https://www.b-tu.de/researchschool/cluster/cluster-3-stochmethod)
- High-Fidelity Simulations of flow inside the Porous Materials [AIAA Publication](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi_hJ22u7jcAhWGKVAKHfaSB2MQFjAAegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Farc.aiaa.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.2514%2F6.2018-3472&usg=AOvVaw0eLhBQyFuI-UqnKwdPerLM)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sparsh-Sharma/sparsh-sharma.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
